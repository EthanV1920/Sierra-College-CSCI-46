// The user input is compared to the longer string and then takes action as follows:

//   - If the input is contained within the longer string, ignore it. Use strstr to perform the search.
//   - If the user input is less than the longer string (as indicated by the return value from strcmp), 
//     prepend the input onto the longer string with a space separating them.
//   - If the input is greater than the longer string, append it with a space separating them.
