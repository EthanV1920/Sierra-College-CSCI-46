# Sierra College CSCI 46

__Author: Ethan Vosburg__

About This Course

This is primarily a course about C programming, but it's placed in the context of a Linux or Unix system, as opposed to a Mac or Windows system. As you go through your college or university years, you'll find that many computer science departments will use C (or perhaps C++) on Linux or Unix systems as one of their primary platforms for programming, exploring computer science concepts, and turning in your work.

We will cover the syntax of the C language, including:

    Functions
    Loops
    Conditionals
    Primitive data types
    Structs and unions
    Source files and header files

No language is complete without a library of useful modules and libraries. We will dip our toes into the standard library, covering topics such as:

    Input & output
    Files
    Memory management
    Process management
    Math functions
    Compiling and linking to the standard libraries

We will also explore a bit of computer networking, including:

    Socket libraries
    Client-server programming

Finally, I don't think this course is complete without learning about "programming in the large" which is about how to manage and maintain larger projects. We'll learn about the procedures and tools that professional developers use such as:

    How to compile multi-file projects
    Makefiles
    Version control systems
    Collaboration with others

I hope you will find this course engaging because we'll cover not only the language itself, which is actually quite small and simple, but also the encompassing ecosystem.
